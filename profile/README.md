rsource is a project started by insyri, aimed to create services around Roblox and specifically the StrafesNET ecosystem.

rsource offers many services for everyone: the average user, beginner or highly skilled map makers, and developers who just got started familiarizing themselves with the StrafesNET API.

rsource has always and will always be open source, all contributions and welcomed.
